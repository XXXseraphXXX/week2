# Introductin- Syntaxs and Semantics
- **First off, what is programming?**
- Programming is the act of writing software to preform a particular task using a programming language uage

Inorder to do that we need to know what sytnax and semantic are.

**Sytnax** is the form of the expressions, statments, and  program units
-
**Semantics** is the meaning of the expressions, statements, and program units
- *note: neither one can be ambiguous 

Syntax and semantics provide a lanuage's definition 
**Grammars** are mechanism that are use to define the syntax
while **Mathematical constructs** like function and set are used to define the semantics

An example of this can be seen in the statement like this:

# Grammars
grammar consists a set colledction of productions.

**productions** use two kinds of structures, terminals(tokens) or non-termials
- There is a special non-terminal symbol that appears in the initial string generated by the grammar called the start symbol
- The sentences of the language are generated through a sequence of applications of the rules, beginning with a start symbol. 
- those rules are grammar and it is use to build a parse trees and derivation trees.
- *note that the start symbol will alway be at the root of the tree.
- by using the tree above we can prove if a sentence belong to a certain grammar 
- example of this would be if we use the sentence:" the dog love that cat" 
- in this case we know that the dog does belong in the noun phase however as we go to the next word love, it is not in the verb  which prove that the sentence do not belong to L(G)

example with using programming language.
